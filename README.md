# Attendence Management using JSP

The Attendance Management system provides a GUI for entering the attendance data and retrieving the data. It has two separate pages for students and admins (Faculties).
The students page has only view access while the admin page has create, edit, update and remove access. 
This performs basic CRUD operations. Uses the Java Bean class to encapsulate the data. It works on the local MySQL database (using XAMPP) and TOMCAT server.
